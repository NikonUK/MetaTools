# Known Bugs/Problems
- Resizing the window will break the ui (to fix this just choose any option)
- Custom recording FPS is broken/unstable
- When inputting the directory of an APK in sideloading, it will crash if the directory/file name has a space in it. (adding quotation marks does not work)
- Choosing Default Resolution in the changing quest resoultion options is the wrong resolution
